Analysis on Shootings in Schools(2009-2018)

•	Performed a time-based analysis of the number of shootings that happened between 2009 and 2018 in the US.

•	Performed locality-based analysis on shootings in each school type as the circumstances and surroundings may not be the same in all localities, the main cause can be identified, and further actions can be taken accordingly.

•	Identified schools and cities where shootings took place more than once, to obtain patterns if any, can be useful for taking enough measures.

INSIGHTS:
Observed that number of incidents had gradually increased from 2012.

Highest number of incidents took place in year 2016. So the change in safety measures in schools may also have an impact.

Incidents took place more than once in three schools - Huffman high school, Horizon elementary school, Booker T.Washington High School. The surroundings around these schools and issues that concern people of that area or students of the schools must be identified to find the root cause of such incidents to some extent.

Cities and States with most number of incidents are identified. The safety measures for students in those place must be reviewed and enough steps must be taken so that no such incidents will take place in future.

Records show that high schools hold highest number of shootings ,where as K-8 and Grades 7-8 schools have lowest. So the rules and safety measures in high schools are to revised . In some cases students might be the culprits(information regarding this is not provided), in that case counscelling sessions for parents and students must be organised periodically inorder to give them some mental support.

Now the number of incidents took place in different types of schools of different localities are observed. Earlier we found that high schools and urban areas have most number of incidents recorded . But in contrast , High schools and middle schools have more number of incidents in suburban areas than the ones in urban areas. So the conditions and safety measure can be compared in such cases .

obviously number of victims who are injured or killed are more in high schools

Whites have committed more number of shootings , where blacks stand in second position. So the culprit's mental condition and the surroundings in which they were brought must be reviewd and steps like monitoring people's mental condition must be taken

But blacks have committed more number of shootings in High schools .

Analysis of Shootings in Schools(2009-2018)

•	Performed a time-based analysis of the number of shootings that happened between 2009 and 2018 in the US.

•	Performed locality-based analysis on shootings in each school type as the circumstances and surroundings may not be the same in all localities, the main cause can be identified, and further actions can be taken accordingly.

•	Identified schools and cities where shootings took place more than once, to obtain patterns if any, can be useful for taking enough measures.

INSIGHTS:
Observed that the number of incidents had gradually increased from 2012.

The highest number of incidents took place in the year 2016. So the change in safety measures in schools may also have an impact.

Incidents took place more than once in three schools - Huffman high school, Horizon elementary school, Booker T.Washington High School. The surroundings around these schools and issues that concern people of that area or students of the schools must be identified to find the root cause of such incidents to some extent.

Cities and States with the most number of incidents are identified. The safety measures for students in those places must be reviewed and enough steps must be taken so that no such incidents will take place in the future.

Most numbers of incidents took place in urban areas followed by suburban and rural areas.

Records show that high schools hold the highest number of shootings, where as K-8 and Grades 7-8 schools have lowest. So the rules and safety measures in high schools are to be revised. In some cases students might be the culprits(information regarding this is not provided), in that case, counseling sessions for parents and students must be organized periodically in order to give them some mental support.

Now the number of incidents that took place in different types of schools of different localities is observed. Earlier we found that high schools and urban areas have the most number of incidents recorded. But in contrast, High schools and middle schools have the number of incidents in suburban areas than the ones in urban areas. So the conditions and safety measure can be compared in such cases.

obviously, the number of victims who are injured or killed is more in high schools

Whites have committed the number of shootings, where blacks stand in the second position. So the culprit's mental condition and the surroundings in which they were brought must be reviewed and steps like monitoring people's mental condition must be taken

But blacks have committed the number of shootings in High schools.

January is the month in which more incidents took place in high schools, whereas Feb and May in the case of Elementary schools. Feb in the case of Middle schools.

the year in which the number of incidents took place is 2016 for High schools,2018 for middle schools.
